# ROCKIN Lab
When I joined the ROCKIN (Robotics and Computational Kinematics and Inovation) research lab at SDSMT in 2022, I started by working with the Yaskawa Motoman GP-12 Industrial Robot and PLC's before taking the intiative to learn ROS (Robot Operating Software). I started using ROS for it's simulation aspects (Gazebo, Ignition Gazebo) as we didn't have any robots in the lab that ran on ROS. I created numerous simulated robots in Gazebo and learned how to use Machine Learning to optomize their construction and coding. Once we got the Turtlebot3-Burger and the TurtleBot4 in the lab, I moved from simulations to real world robots.

# TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4
TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4 are open-source robots developed and manufactured by the company ROBOTIS. They are primarily used in research applications and I am currently using both of them in the ROCKIN lab. Because the TB3 runs on ROS1 and the TB4 runs on ROS2, I have experience using both of these platforms as well as their counterparts (RVIS/RVIS2, SLAM, NAV/NAV2). I also have experience using the ROS1-ROS2 bridge, allowing both platforms to communicate. My main focus in the lab is multi-robot fleet control. By creating a central map that takes lidar inputs from all of the robots we are able to make autonomous navigation much safer. Because of this and other properties of ROS2, the robots are also able to communicate with each other, which in turn allows them to interact with each other via the robotic arm I applied to one of the Turtlebot 4's.

# SphereWalker
SphereWalker is a hexapod walker that uses a four-bar linkage system to minamize the number of actuators needed to operate. Along with other members of ROCKIN, we are devolping a prototype of SphereWalker for NASA. I am currently trying to implement ROS2(Humble) on the SphereWalker.

# Astro (Unitree GO-2 EDU)
Astro, as he is affectionatley known in the lab, is a Unitree GO-2 EDU robotic dog. Since Astro comes with ROS2 Foxy on-board, I was able to comunicate with
