An overview of John Miller's relevant projects

# TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4
TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4 are opee-source robots developed and manufactured by the company ROBOTIS. They are primarily used in research applications and I am currently using both of them in the ROCKIN (Robotics and Kinomatics Inovation) Research Lab at SDSMT

# SphereWalker
SphereWalker is a hexapod walker that uses a four-bar linkage system to minamize the number of actuators needed to operate. Along with other members of ROCKIN, we are devolping a prototype of SphereWalker for NASA. I am currently trying to implement ROS2(Humble) on the SphereWalker.
