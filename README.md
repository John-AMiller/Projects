An overview of John Miller's relevant projects

# ROCKIN Lab
When I joined the ROCKIN (Robotics and Computational Kinematics and Inovation) research lab at SDSMT in 2022, I started by working with the Yakasawa Motoman GP-12 Industrial Robot, before taking the intiative to learn ROS (Robot Operating Software). Up until this July I was mainly using ROS for it's simulation aspects as we didn't have any robots in the lab that ran on ROS. I created numerous simulated robots in Gazebo and learned how to use Machine Learning to optomize their construction and coding. Once we got the TB3-B and the TurtleBot4, I moved from simulations to real world robots.

# TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4
TurtleBot3-Burger and TurtleBot4 are opee-source robots developed and manufactured by the company ROBOTIS. They are primarily used in research applications and I am currently using both of them in the ROCKIN lab.

# SphereWalker
SphereWalker is a hexapod walker that uses a four-bar linkage system to minamize the number of actuators needed to operate. Along with other members of ROCKIN, we are devolping a prototype of SphereWalker for NASA. I am currently trying to implement ROS2(Humble) on the SphereWalker.
